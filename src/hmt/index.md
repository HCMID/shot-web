# Explore published releases of the Homer Multitext project


We're planning to host dashboards letting you work interactively with published releases of [the Homer Multitext project](https://www.homermultitext.org) (HMT).

The HMT dashboards can also be run locally. They are available from [this github repository](https://github.com/homermultitext/dashboards).
